This web solution is part of Request Apprentice Training (RAT) project. Here the provider users can search for apprentice training requests created by employers and optionally respond to them.

## How It Works
Users are expected to have an account on the DfE Sign In which allows them to access the Request Training service 
When running this locally, with stub sign-in enabled, the launch url should be `https://localhost:8801/`
